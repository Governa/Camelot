<h1>Manage a Camelot project</h1>

<p>Once a project has been created and set up as described in the basics tutorial, it needs
to be maintained and managed over time.</p>

<p>Two tools exist to assist in the management of Camelot projects :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>camelot/bin/camelot-admin.py is oriented towards developers of the project, it is used for
the creation of projects and the creation of schema revisions.</p></li>
<li><p>camelot/bin/manage.py is oriented towards administrators of an installed camelot project, it
is used for interacting with and migration of the database to a certain schema revision.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both tools support the --help command line argument to provide a list of available commands.</p>

<p>python camelot/bin/manage.py --help</p>

<h2>Command line interaction with the model</h2>

<pre><code>python camelot/bin/manage.py console
</code></pre>

<p>launches a python console with the model all setup for interaction.  Within the example
movie project one could do within the console :</p>

<pre><code>from model import Movie
for movie in Movie.query.all():
  print movie.title
</code></pre>

<p>to print a list of all movie titles to the screen.</p>

<h2>Schema revisions and migrations</h2>

<p>Camelot makes use of the sqlalchemy-migrate library to assist with schema revisions and
migrations.  When creating a new project, the camelot-admin.py tool creates a schema
repository for your project in the repository directory in the project path.</p>

From the Python Package Index
=============================

First, make sure you have setup tools installed, `Setup tools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.
If you are using a debian based distribution, you can type::

  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Then use easy_install to install Camelot, under Linux this would be done by typing::

  sudo easy_install camelot
  
From source
===========

When installing Camelot from source, you need to make sure all dependencies
like `PyQT <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/>`_, 
`SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ and `Elixir <http://elixir.ematia.de/>`_ are installed
and available in your **PYTHONPATH**.

Releases
--------

The source code of a release can be downloaded from the 
`Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Camelot/>`_ and then
extracted::

  tar xzvf Camelot-10.07.02.tar.gz

Trunk
-----

The latest and greatest version of the source can be checked out
from the subversion repository::

  svn co http://guest:guest@repository.conceptive.be/camelot/svn/trunk/
  
Adapting PYTHONPATH
-------------------

You need to make sure Camelot and all its dependencies are in the **PYTHONPATH**
before you start using it::

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/Camelot-10.07.02
  
or::

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/Camelot-10.07.02:path to sqlalchemy:path to elxir:...
  
Verifiy the installation
========================

To verify if you have Camelot installed and available in the **PYTHONPATH**, fire up a
python interpreter::

  python
  
and issue these commands::

  >>> import camelot
  >>> print camelot.__version__
  >>> import sqlalchemy
  >>> print sqlalchemy.__version__
  >>> import elixir
  >>> print elixir.__version__
  >>> import PyQt4
  
None of them should raise an ImportError.
